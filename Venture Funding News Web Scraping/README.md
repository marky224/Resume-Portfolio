# VC Funding Scrap and Store

## Project Goals
Analyzing data on new funding rounds and the funded companies, to help teams maximize the ROI of new/innovative markets by:
- Collecting data on venture captical funding rounds and the venture-funded companies.
- Cleaning/formatting the collected data and ordering it by funding date and time.
- Storing information into various forms of data such as excel, csv and SQL.

## Abstract
Through data that is sourced from the VCNewsDaily website, this project collects information on new venture funding rounds, along with the associated details on the funding round and companies. To develop a clean list of leads [for education purposes] that can be used for various purposes such as: product development, market research and/or business development.

## Intro
Venture capital as a funding type offers huge potential rewards, but with huge risks as well. In fact, it is well-known that most venture-funded startups never end up making it to the initial public offering (IPO) stage - although this might not always be the most ideal end goal (i.e., acquisition). But for those that do go through multiple venture funds and make it to the IPO, this type of funding has been responsible for most (if not all) of the newer tech giants that are now synonomous with Silicon Valley (i.e., Facebook, Google, Twitter, SalesForce, Uber, Doordash, Tesla). Given how venture capital works in stages, there is so much insight that venture funding reveals about developing trends in sales and/or technology.
