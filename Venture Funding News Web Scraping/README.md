## Intro
Venture capital as funding type offers huge potential rewards, but at the costs of huge potential risks as well. In fact, while most start-up companies that receive venture funding never become the success they sought out to be, for those that do end up making it to their initial public offering (IPO), this type of funding has been responsible for most (if not all) of the newer tech giants that are synonomous with Silicon Valley: Facebook, Google, Twitter, SalesForce, Uber, Doordash, Tesla, etc. Understanding that venture capital works in stages, there is a lot of insight that venture funding reveals about trends in sales and/or technology.
