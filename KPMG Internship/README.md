# Project Summary
Retail sales have been shown to be significantly effected by a variety of factors - from customer satisfaction, age, weather, lighting, e-commerce shopping trends. Understanding this, we're going to be helping a bike shop owner understand what customer features they should be focusing on in order to maximize the ROI of their marketing efforts and predict sales of new customers (for current and new markets) by analyzing their customer demographics, transaction history data, and leveraging other variables from outside data as needed (i.e., weather, google trends). The end goal is to help them develop data-driven client profiles based on their transaction data, along with predicting future sales of new customers based on their demographic information.


## Project Outline
Analyzing customer and transaction data to allow a bike shop owner to maximize their marketing ROI for going into new markets by:
- Identify which customer features drive purchases (i.e., age, wealth, city) and understand to what degree they influence purchases
- Determine how many customer profiles should be developed, along with identifying feature averages for each customer profile
- Calculate customer lifetime value (CLV) for current customers and predicting CLV of new customers based on their feature profile
