## Identifying Ideal Customers and Predicting New Sales with CRM Data

Abstract:

Through a dataset provided by KPMG, we're going to be helping a bicycle shop owner maximize their marketing ROI by using their historical data on customers and transactions. Developing customer profiles based on data and helping to estimate news sales based off of previous transactions and customer demographic information.


Introduction:

  As online sales continue to grow as a sales channel for most companies, so is the importance of using online marketing to help drive in-store traffic and sales as well. And while most companies are doing a great job of acquring and storing their customers' information (via rewards programs and email lists) into a customer relationship management (CRM) database, most companies are having a tough time using that data to help drive new sales.
  
  In this study, we're going to be helping a bike shop owner maximize their historical data on their customers and transactions, to keep marketing focused on the customer segments that are most profitable and drive the most sales. With the goal of identifying the most profitable bike lines and customer segments, along with identifying which customer traits are associated with higher profits and more frequent purchases.

Methods:

Our study's dataset came from a KPMG virtual internship for a bicycle shop based in Australia, with the dataset being modeled after datasets of customers that have similar business profiles. The dataset came in the form of an excel sheet and included the followed four datasets: Customer Address, Customer Demographic, Transactions, New Customers (Address and Demographics). The dataset for 'New Customers' was disregarded since 'Transactions' only had customer ID numbers for the 'Customer' dataset. For the initial data quality check, we checked the completeness of our data to see that DATASET had ##% of complete data, DATASET had ##% of complete data and DATASET had ##% of complete data.
