Abstract:

Through a dataset provided by KPMG, helping a bicycle shop owner maximize their Marketing ROI by using their historical data on customers and transactions. Developing customer profiles based on data and helping to estimate news sales based on customer demographic information.


Introduction:

  As online sales continue to grow as a sales channel for most companies, so is the importance of using online marketing to help drive in-store traffic and sales as well. And while most companies are doing a great job of acquring and storing their customers' information (via rewards programs and email lists) into a customer relationship management (CRM) database, most companies are having a tough time using that data to help drive new sales.
  
  In this study, we're going to be helping a bike shop owner maximize their historical data on their customers and transactions, to keep marketing focused on the customer segments that are most profitable and drive the most sales. With the goal of identifying the most profitable bike lines and customer segments, along with identifying which customer traits are associated with higher profits and more frequent purchases.

Methods:

The dataset for our study came from a KPMG virtual internship for a bicycle shop based in Australia, with the dataset being modeled after customer data with similar business profiles. The dataset came in an excel sheet and included the followed four datasets: Customer Address, Customer Demographic, Transactions, New Customers (Address and Demographics).
